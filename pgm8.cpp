 Program 8

 This program is going to expand on the last program that you wrote.
 In this program, you are going to add additional features to your program.
 You are an avid reader and have decided that you would like to keep track of
 the books that you read.
 Since you are now a seasoned C++ programmer, you are going to write a
 C++ program to perform this function.
 You will define a structure called book_list that will hold a number associated
 with each book (int), book title (string), author (string), a description of the
 book (string), a date when the book was read stored in 2 parts â€“ month (int) and
 year (int) and a rating of the book (int). The number will be generated by the
 program as each book is entered. The rating should be limited to a number
 between 1 and 10. It will be a scale the user can enter what they thought of
 the book.


 Pgm7 Pseudo-Code

 Define structure
 holds 7 variables.
 Main
 make and open file ("reading_list.txt", std::ios_base::app)
 int b.booknum to 1
 while bool is true
 ask for book name
 if b.bookname != "exit"
 add to reading list
 Ask user for author
 add to reading list
 Ask user for description
 add to reading list
 Ask for month
 add to reading list
 Ask for year
 add to reading list
 Ask for rating
 add to reading reading list
 else
 bool becomes false
